Im Frabina, Im currently interested in Computer Science, I am persuing a degree in it as well as doing a minor in STEM Education.
Specifically I like gaming but as of now I am a blank slate so I'm willing to learn and work on anything. 
Currently, I'm learning C++ but I have prior experience in Java and Python as well as had my foot in the water of HTML. 
Collaborating on any projects would be a great opportunity for me to gain more experience.
I can be reached on Discord @Snowie727, my pronouns are she/her
